# Personal Expense Tracker using Python and SQL
I made a personal expense tracker using Python (python3) and SQL(sqlite). This can be used on Command Prompt or Terminal. This expense tracker can be used to add, view, delete and summarize daily expenses.
I made this code with the intention of using my Python and SQL knowledge onto a practical use.
